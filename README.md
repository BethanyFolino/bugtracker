# Bug Tracker
Bug Tracker is an app that allows users to create tickets so they can report bugs.

Logged in users can create new users, tickets are color-coded based on status (new = white, in-progress = yellow, completed = green, invalid = red), only the creator of a ticket can edit it, only the user assigned to a ticket is able to mark it as completed, assigned and completed tickets are not allowed to be assigned to someone else, the homepage is only accessible through logging in.

I made the original version of this app as part of the curriculum while I participated in Kenzie Academy's software engineering program. Styling and ability to create users were not part of the project requirements, but I added them later. I mostly used Bootstrap for styling.
